# Colored-MNIST
Build VAE and Cycle Gan on colored-MNIST data
In this task a build a colored MNIST data, with specific color for each digit.
##VAE
With this dataset i build two Vae models(one continuous and one discriminate) and that generate new images from this dataset. 
##Cycle-Gan
In this task i build two colored-MNIST datasets, one is same as the previous, and the second is different color for each digit. 
I build a cycle-gan model that convert one colored digit from some dataset to the other color from the other dataset.
